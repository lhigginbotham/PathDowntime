/*
	Step 1—Add Up Costs: 
		These costs include ongoing or recurring costs for your buildings, organizations, and other previous downtime activities 
		that have accrued since the last time you have had a downtime session. Most of these costs are incurred daily, whether 
		or not you are spending downtime days at the settlement.
	Step 2—Pay Costs: 
		If you cannot pay the costs you’ve incurred (either with your own capital or by borrowing from another character), you 
		gain no benefit from those downtime activities until the day you do pay.
	Step 3—Determine Capital Attrition: 
		For every 7 days you were away from the settlement (whether downtime days or normal days), reduce your Goods, Influence, 
		Labor, and Magic by 1 each (minimum 0). This decrease represents spoilage, theft, allies moving on or having higher 
		priorities, workers finding other employment, and so on.
	Step 4—Determine Business Attrition: 
		Business attrition is loss caused by poor morale among employees due to your absence. If a building doesn’t generate 
		capital (and therefore isn’t a business), skip Step 4. Without any employees to speculate about your absence, there 
		is no chance of mutiny. However, the GM may decide that opportunistic thieves, squatters, monsters, animals, or vermin 
		may move into an abandoned building if you are gone for a long time, requiring you to clear them out if you want to use it again.
